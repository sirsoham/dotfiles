Oh, how nice open source software is.\n\n## Notes:\n  * Quantum works best with the Source Code Pro font. If you have it installed you can enable via Atom's settings by entering \"Source Code Pro\" into the Font Family field.\n","_id":"quantum-ui@0.2.2","_shasum":"fd0bdb954af48afb62a0108913ae95d8b5bde363","_resolved":"file:../d-11576-72171-15uf7pv/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11576-72171-15uf7pv/package.tgz"}
